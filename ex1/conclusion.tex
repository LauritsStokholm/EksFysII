Generally, we can not confirm the Fresnel relations with our data, since our data are not within the acceptable errors in comparison with the theory. This is probably due to our own lack of abilities to perform the measurements precisely and influences from other sources of uncertainties rather than the Fresnel relations not holding for the experiment generally. It is also very unsatisfactory that we were not able to perfrom the measurement for the reflection of $s$-polarized light and the "glass to air". We can however conclude that our data fits fairly well with the Fresnel relations for smaller angles of reflection and larger transmission angles, thus we can conclude that our data at least confirms the theory in these limits. The general conclusion must be that we need to make a better planned and more structured experiment to fully produce data that can confirm the Fresel Relations.
