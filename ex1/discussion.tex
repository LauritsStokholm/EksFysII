Generally our data does not correlate with the theory under the errors we have taken into consideration.

One of the greatest uncertainties in the experiment is reseting the angular measuremt tool. Multiple times during the measurements we experienced that the outer disk rotated with the inner disk when we changed the incoming angle. This has of course contributed to uncertainties on the angle wich we did not take into notice when estimating the uncertainty on the incoming angle. This might also be the one major error that have affected our data so severely that we are not capable of confirming the fresmel relations.
