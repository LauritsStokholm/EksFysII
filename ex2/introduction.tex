\section{Introduction}
We look at reflection and refraction of a beam of light at the surface of a transparent dielectric. The laws of relection and refraction (\emph{Snell's law}) determine the directions of the reflected and refracted beams. But they are purely geometrical, and no information of intensity nor polarization is given. These are given by the \emph{Fresnel Relations}. This exercise studies the Fresnel relations in detail, and experimental data will be compared with the well known theory of Snell's Law.
