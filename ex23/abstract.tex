This paper is written as a concatenation of the second and third of four mandatory repports during the course \emph{Experimental Physics II}. In the two experiment we will be working with interferometers. The Michelson interferometer in which different set up will be discussed and the expansion coefficient of a piezoelectric element is determined is of the first repport where as the last will focus mainly on the Mach Zehnder interferometer. At last the effect of intensity differences of the interferometer arms will be studied.
