\subsubsection{Blackbody radiation}
All matter emits electromagnetic radiation when it has a temperature above
absolute zero. This radiative distribution of entropy is called thermal
radiation and is a spontaneous process.

Similarly, all matter absorbs electromagnetic radiation to some degree. In
addition, a blackbody is an object that absorbs all radiation of all
wavelengths that falls upon it. Furthermore, at thermal equillibrium a
blackbody emits a characteristic frequency distribution, which is temperature
depended.
